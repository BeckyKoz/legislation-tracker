# Legislation Tracker for Environmental Policies

A web application that tracks environmental laws and policies, allowing users to search, filter, and stay updated on legislation related to sustainability. 

As an early-career software engineer, I am always looking for portfolio projects that are meaningful to me and will help me develop relevant skills. I used ChatGPT to brainstorm ideas and act as a "coworker" to confirm strategies as I worked. 

As I continue working on this project, I intend to make sure it's extensible to other types of legislation (especially pertaining to education, civil liberties, science, and other important topics). 


## Features
- Search and filter policies by **region, category, and status**.
- View upcoming **legislation timelines** and effective dates.
- Subscribe for **email notifications** on new policies.
- Get tools for **advocacy** (e.g., contact lawmakers, petitions).
- Data sourced from **Congress.gov and Open States API**.

## Tech Stack
- **Frontend:** React, TailwindCSS
- **Backend:** Node.js, Express.js
- **Database:** PostgreSQL / MongoDB
- **Data Sources:** Congress.gov API, Open States API, Web Scraping (for non-API sources)
